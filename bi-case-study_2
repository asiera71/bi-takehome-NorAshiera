### 📂 Case Study: Merchant Performance Analysis

BonusLink partners with multiple merchants, and management is keen to evaluate which merchants are underperforming or overperforming in terms of customer engagement and transaction volume.

**You are provided with the following mock datasets** (CSV or SQL-compatible):

* `transactions.csv` — list of transactions with merchant, member ID, timestamp, and spend amount
* `members.csv` — member ID, signup date, and tier
* `merchants.csv` — merchant ID, category, location, and join date

---

### 🧠 Task:

1. **Data Cleaning & Exploration**

   * Perform basic EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
   * Identify any data quality issues or assumptions

2. **Merchant Performance Metrics**

   * Define and calculate relevant KPIs for merchant performance (e.g., number of active members, avg spend per member, retention rate)
    - Total spend by merchant and average spend per member
   * Identify top and bottom merchants using your metrics
	- By looking at the average spend by member 
	 Top 3 :
	 1. Merchant 14 (RM56.40)
	 2. Merchant 20 (RM53.40)
	 3. Merchant 18 (RM53.36)
	 
	 Bottom 3:
	 1. Merchant 9 (RM43.60)
	 2. Merchant 17 (RM46.55)
	 3. Merchant 19 (RM46.66)
	
	
	3. **Insights & Recommendations**

   * Summarize key business insights
    - Merchants with higher Spend per Customer are doing well in terms of customer retention and pricing strategy. 
	- If a merchant has a low Spend per Customer, they might not be maximizing revenue from each customer.
   * Recommend what actions should be taken for underperforming merchants
    - improve customer engagement:
		> Loyalty Programs: Introduce a loyalty program that encourages repeat purchases. For example, points systems, discounts after a certain number of purchases, or exclusive offers for returning customers.
		> Personalized Marketing: Use customer data to send personalized offers based on their purchase history. 

4. **Dashboard/Visualization**

   * Build a simple dashboard to communicate your findings (in Tableau Public or screenshots if using other tools)
   * Include filters or interactive components if applicable
